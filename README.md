# HerdImmunityToy
My version of the MonteCarlo simulation of herd immunity - based on http://op12no2.me/toys/herd/

Full credit for the idea goes to the creator of http://op12no2.me/toys/herd/

This is my version as a little python project basically to keep myself amused. May turn it into a web based app one day.
